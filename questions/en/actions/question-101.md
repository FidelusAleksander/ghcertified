question: "How do you ensure that `Upload Failure test report` step is executed only if `Run Tests` step fails?"
documentation: "https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#status-check-functions"

- [x] 
```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  id: run-tests
  run: npm run test

- name: Upload Failure test report
  if: failure() && steps.run-tests.outcome == 'failure'
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-report
    path: test-reports.html
```
> `failure()` overrides the default `success()` status check so the step can run after a failure, and the outcome check targets the specific step.

- [ ] 
```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  id: run-tests
  run: npm run test

- name: Upload Failure test report
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-report
    path: test-reports.html
```
> `always()` works but runs the step even on cancellation, which is broader than needed.

- [ ] 
```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  id: run-tests
  run: npm run test

- name: Upload Failure test report
  if: steps.run-tests.outcome == 'failure'
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-report
    path: test-reports.html
```
> Without a status check function like `failure()`, the implicit `success()` is applied, so this step is skipped after a failure even though the outcome check is correct.

- [ ] 
```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  id: run-tests
  run: npm run test

- name: Upload Failure test report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-report
    path: test-reports.html
```
> No `if` condition at all — this step only runs when all previous steps succeed (the default behavior).
