This repository contains a series of questions related to GitHub Features. Questions are divided depending on which feature they refer to.
All questions are test-type, they can be single or multiple choice questions.

All answers should be believable, even if they are wrong, so the test taker can truly test their knowledge.

Each question is a markdown file with a specific format. The format is available in `archetypes/questions.md` as a template which is later reused in `content/questions/**` files.
