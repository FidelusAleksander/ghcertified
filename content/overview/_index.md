## Preparation

You can visit the official [GitHub site](https://resources.github.com/learn/certifications/) for more information about the certifications and official study resources. 


## Practice
Official study resources are a good way to start, but don't limit yourself to them. Read through the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), try out the features, and build something!

Once You are ready to take the exam, attempt the available [**practice tests**]({{< ref "practice_tests/_index.md" >}}) to get a feel for the exam format and the types of questions You will encounter.
