title: "Question 147"
question: "Which of the following capabilities are specific to GitHub Copilot Business (and not available in individual Copilot plans like Free/Pro)?"
---

> **More info**: [Plans for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/plans)
- [x] Centralized billing and seat management for an organization
- [x] SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) and organization-wide policy controls
- [] AI code completions and Copilot Chat in supported IDEs
> AI completions and Copilot Chat are available to individual plans as well (not Business-only).
- [] Access for verified students and teachers at no cost
> Free access for verified students/teachers applies to individual plans, not Business.
- [] Enhanced privacy controls where suggestions are not retained by default
> While Business emphasizes stronger privacy posture, “suggestions not retained” is an organizational policy benefit tied to Business; however, GitHub positions the core privacy and model features across plans, and this phrasing can be ambiguous. For test clarity, treat this option as not uniquely Business in this item.
