1. [ ] When you clone a repository, changes you push go directly to the original repository. Forking requires a separate local copy.  
  > Cloning and forking both result in separate local copies, but pushing to a clone requires the correct permission on the original repo.  
1. [x] Forking creates a copy under your GitHub account, while cloning creates a local copy on your computer without linking ownership to your account.  
  > **Correct**. A fork is a GitHub-level copy that appears in your account, whereas a clone is a local-only copy.  
1. [ ] Cloning always transfers repository ownership, while forking does not.  
1. [ ] Only private repositories can be forked, whereas only public repositories can be cloned.
