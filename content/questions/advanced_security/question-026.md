- [x] GitHub derives dependencies automatically from manifests and lock files committed to the repository
- [x] Dependencies can be manually added using the Dependency submission API
- [ ] GitHub scans the repository code for import statements of external packages
- [ ] It's required to add a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the official `actions/dependency-graph` GitHub Action to add dependencies to the graph whenever a new commit is pushed to the repository
