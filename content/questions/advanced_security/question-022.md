1. [x] Define regex patterns for these secrets and enable custom patterns for secret scanning for the organization.
1. [ ] The company should join the GitHub partner program so the pattern of the companies secrets is recognized.
> GitHub partner program is meant for service providers which distribute secrets outside of their organization (e.g cloud providers). It's not meant for internal secrets of a single organization.
1. [ ] Define custom GitHub Actions workflows for repositories in the organization that will scan for these secrets.
1. [ ] In all repositories include `secret_scanning.yml` file which will define these custom secrets that should be scanned for.
> `secret_scanning.yml` file that can be used to disable secret scanning for specific files or directories.
