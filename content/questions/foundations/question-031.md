- [x] You can stop and restart a Codespace without losing the changes that you make to your project.
- [x] You can disconnect and reconnect to an active Codespace without affecting its running processes.
- [ ] You can stop and restart a Codespace without affecting its running processes.
- [ ] If you create another Codespace on a branch which already had a Codespace running on it, the original Codespace will be deleted
- [ ] If you close the browser tab in which your Codespace was running, the Codespace will automatically be stopped
> Closing the browser tab does not stop the Codespace and the processes continue running. If you only closed the tab, the Codespace will stop after reaching the inactivity timeout period
