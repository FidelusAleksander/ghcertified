      secrets: inherit
```

1. [x] All secrets available to `workflow A`  will be also available to `workflow B`, but not to `workflow C`
1. [ ] All secrets from `octo-org` organization and `octo-org/example-repo` repository will be available to `workflow B`, but not to `workflow C`
> Not all secrets from `octo-org` organization have to be made available to `octo-org/example-repo`.
1. [ ] All secrets available to `workflow A` will be also available to `workflow B` and `workflow C`
> `Workflow B` would need to add `secrets: inherit` when calling `workflow C`
1. [ ] Only repository and environment secrets available to `workflow A` will be available to `workflow B`, but not to `workflow C`. Organization scoped secrets cannot be inherited
