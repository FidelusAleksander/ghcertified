1. [x] job3 will run after job1 and job2 have completed, regardless of whether they were successful
1. [ ] You cannot use `if: ${{ always() }}` and `needs` together. The workflow will fail on startup.
1. [ ] job3 will run after job1 and job2 have been successfully completed
1. [ ] job3 will run after both job1 and job2 have failed
