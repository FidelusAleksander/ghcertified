      strategy:

1. [x] Set `jobs.example_matrix.strategy.max-parallel` to 2
1. [ ] Set `jobs.example_matrix.strategy.concurrency` to 2
1. [ ] Use Github's REST API to check if the job count is lesser than 2
1. [ ] It's not possible, a matrix will always run all of the jobs in parallel if there are runners available
